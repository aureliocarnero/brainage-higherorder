Summary of the higher-order statistical three-dimensional spatial frequency analysis method for brain age inference (as part of the Cosmic Brain project), showing the process from the input MRI data (top-left) to the outcome (right): normalized covariance matrix (top-right) and regression between the predicted brain age and the actual chronological age (bottom-right). The MRI data can be represented as an intensity array I(r) in a cubical mesh with voxel coordinates r = {rx, ry , rz }. The Fourier transform of I(r) is represented as a function of the k-vector. The power spectrum P (k) represents a measure of the two-point clustering statistical (squared) amplitude as a function of spatial frequency distance, while the bispectrum B(k1, k2, k3) represents the analogous quantity for the three-point statistics, as a function of triangle configurations.
